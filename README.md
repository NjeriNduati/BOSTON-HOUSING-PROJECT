# BOSTON-HOUSING-PROJECT
# Boston Housing Project

## Overview
The **Boston Housing Project** aims to analyze and predict housing prices in the Boston area using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes various factors such as crime rates, property tax rates, and the number of rooms per dwelling, which influence housing prices. By leveraging data analysis and predictive modeling, this project provides insights into the key drivers of real estate prices.

## Goal
The primary objective of this project is to build a **predictive model** that estimates the **median value of owner-occupied homes** based on several features. Through data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning techniques, the project aims to develop an accurate pricing model.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **Boston Housing Dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes 506 observations and 14 attributes.

### Features:
- **CRIM**: Crime rate by town
- **ZN**: Proportion of residential land zoned for large lots
- **INDUS**: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town
- **CHAS**: Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
- **NOX**: Nitrogen oxide concentration (parts per 10 million)
- **RM**: Average number of rooms per dwelling
- **AGE**: Proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940
- **DIS**: Weighted distance to employment centers
- **RAD**: Index of accessibility to radial highways
- **TAX**: Property tax rate per $10,000
- **PTRATIO**: Pupil-teacher ratio by town
- **B**: Proportion of residents of African American descent
- **LSTAT**: Percentage of lower status population
- **MEDV**: Median value of owner-occupied homes (Target variable)


## Model Development Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing correlations and feature distributions.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Selecting the most influential features.
4. **Model Training:** Applying regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
5. **Evaluation:** Measuring performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared values.

## Results
The best-performing model provides an accurate estimation of housing prices based on historical data, demonstrating the impact of different factors on Boston's real estate market.
